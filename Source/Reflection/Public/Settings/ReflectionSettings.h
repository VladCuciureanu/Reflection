/* What becomes of a file that holds more than one asset.
 *
 * Most hold one and this decides nothing for them. Some hold a set: an HLOD proxy keeps the mesh it
 * stands in for, the material that draws it and the texture that material samples, all under the
 * one name, and every reference between them is written as a step inside that one file.
 *
 * Kept together they come out as the game keeps them, which is what those references describe, and
 * the content browser lists them side by side regardless. Split apart each becomes a file of its
 * own, which is easier to move one of, and leaves the references between them pointing at a file
 * that no longer holds what they name. */
